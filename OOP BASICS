CLASSES - Are user defined data types that act as the blueprint.
OBJECTS - Are instances of a class created with specifically defined data.
METHODS - A block of code which only runs when it is called.
ATTRIBUTES - Represents the state of and object. in other words, they are the characteristics that distinguish classes.

PRICIPLES OF OOP

ENCAPSULATION - All important information is contained inside an object
ABSTRACTION - Exposing only the necessary information to the user.
INHERITANCE - Can reuse code and properties from other classes.
POLYMORPHISM - It facilitates flexibility and the ability to define methods in multiple forms.


BENEFITS OF OOP

MODULARITY - Making troubleshooting and collaborative development faster.
REUSABILITY - Code can be reused, Does not need to write the same code multiple times.
PRODUCTIVITY - Can construct new programs quickly through the use of multiple libraries
EASILY UPGRADABLE - Can implement system functionalities independently 
INTERFACE DESCRIPTIONS - Interfaces are points of communication between different components of an application or system. They can also define interactions between a hardware device, software program and a user.
SECURITY - 
FLEXIBILITY -
CODE MAINTENANCE -
LOWER COST -
